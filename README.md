## üìå Project Overview

**MIDILLI MIDI Web Tool** is a powerful web-based MIDI utility, serving as a Swiss Army knife for MIDI tasks. 
It allows real-time monitoring and sending of MIDI messages directly from your browser, no installation needed.

The project is based on a single library, **[midi.js](midi.js)**, which is a 1-to-1 reimplementation of  
[rtmidi](https://github.com/thestk/rtmidi) for the web, providing robust MIDI handling in the browser environment  
with a single HTML file.

**MIDI Monitor & Sender** is integrated into the tool, enabling seamless MIDI message inspection and transmission to 
connected MIDI devices.
